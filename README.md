# TicketViewer

TicketViewer gets and displays all the tickets for my user and allows you to browse individual tickets. 

## Installation

TicketViewer requires no installation. Just unzip the archive and run TicketViewer.exe However, if you want to run the unit tests, you will need to install the following libraries as I have used them in the program.

requests | for making HTTP requests

prettytable | for making tables to display data

Besides TicketViewer.exe, the archive contains the source code in TicketViewer.â€‹py and Unit Tests in test_TicketViewer.py. To run unit tests, simply run test_TicketViewer.py in any python interpreter.
